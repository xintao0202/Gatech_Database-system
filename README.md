# Gatech_Database-system: ERMS

## Overview
This is a database course project. The goal for this project is to build a Emergency Resource Management System, which can help individuals, company and government locate and activate resources after an emergency such as a natural disaster, hazardous material spill, act of terrorism, nuclear incident, or another catastrophic event. Users of the system can add their own resources to the system, search for resources based on keywords or location, request available resources, track the status of resources, and record information about emergency incidences.

## Details and breakdown of project
The total project has been split into three parts. In the first part, we need to create the Information Flow Diagram for the system. Besides we need to design the EER diagram as well as some initial Data formatting. The report for this phase is listed as phase_1_report.pdf

In the second phase, we need to process the EER diagram to Relational mapping, and also need to SQL Create Table statements to create your schema. The report for this phase is listed as phase_2_report.pdf

In the last phae, we need to use WAMP stack, implement our system in MySQL and PHP. All implementation code for this part is in the file ERMS_SRC. Also to help understand the use of our system, here is the link to a Youtube demo:
